# Sales Analysis Excel Project

Welcome to the Sales Analysis Excel Project! This project is all about diving into sales data using Microsoft Excel to uncover valuable insights. We’ll be analyzing customer behaviors and trends to help understand what drives sales.

## The Dataset

Our dataset is stored in an Excel file called `Raw Data.xlsx` and includes the following columns:

- ID
- Marital Status
- Gender
- Income
- Number of Children
- Education Level
- Occupation
- Home Ownership
- Number of Cars
- Commute Distance
- Region
- Age
- Age Group
- Bike Purchase Status

## Project Highlights

Here’s what we’ve done in this project:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: We started by cleaning and prepping the data in Excel to ensure everything is accurate and ready for analysis.

- **Pivot Tables and Charts**: We used Excel’s powerful pivot tables and charts to create visual representations of the data, helping us identify patterns and key insights.

- **Sales Analysis Dashboard**: The project wraps up with an interactive dashboard built in Excel. This dashboard offers a clear overview of the sales data and lets you explore important metrics and trends at a glance.
